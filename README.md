### Studio Ghibli

This is a website dedicated to showcasing the videographic milestones of Studio Ghibli. The website provides information about Studio Ghibli's popular films and allows users to explore their extensive collection. It was developed using TypeScript, SCSS, and React.js. This allowed greater control over individual site elements while speeding up the development process compared to vanilla JavaScript and CSS. 

### A Visual IDE for React Projects

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- Edit, render and compose apps that make use of **`React`**-based components.
- Create components with **`TypeScript`**, **`SCSS`** and **`CSS Modules`** support.
- Visually edit in real-time and in an isolated environment.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Notable Features

The website features:
1. Popular films from Studio Ghibli: The team ensured that a range of Studio Ghibli’s fan classics and popular films were featured, presented, and described in the site with a strong visual appeal. This helps newcomers identify what films are best as an introductory to Studio Ghibli’s revolutionary artstyle and long-time fans recall certain movies that may have been forgotten.
2. Responsive Design: The website layout is refined to fit different devices and screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience for users on desktops, tablets, and on mobile devices.
3. Intuitive Navigation: The website features intuitive visual elements, allowing users to browse through different film categories, access film details, and navigate back to the home page effortlessly, while feeling immersed in Studio Ghibli’s art direction.

However, during the development process, some challenges were encountered. These included:

1. Collaboration: The move to typescript and using a very different framework proved to be a leap in difficulty for some team members, resulting in some difficulties in applying certain concepts learned from the usual HTML/CSS/JavaScript programming languages.

2. Responsive Design: Designing a responsive and consistent layout that adapts seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes required testing, fine-tuning, and persistence. 

3. Information Accuracy: As multiple films by Studio Ghibli were featured on the website, information such as running screen time, movie titles, and descriptions were scrutinized and cross-checked to ensure that each entry accurately represents the movie depicted by the website.
